# Manual Testing Notes

Manual testing is a type of software testing where test cases are executed manually by a tester without using any automation tools. Below are comprehensive notes, organized topic-wise, with image references for better understanding.

## 1. Introduction to Manual Testing
Manual testing is the process of manually checking software for defects. The tester takes over the role of an end user and tests the software to find unexpected behavior or bugs.

## 2. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
SDLC is a process used by the software industry to design, develop, and test high-quality software. It consists of phases such as Requirement Gathering, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance.

## 3. Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)
STLC is a sequence of specific actions performed during the testing process to ensure software quality goals are met.

**Phases:** Requirement Analysis, Test Planning, Test Case Development, Test Environment Setup, Test Execution, Test Cycle Closure.

## 4. Types of Testing
### a. Functional Testing
### b. Non-Functional Testing
Tests non-functional aspects like performance, usability, reliability, etc.
### c. Regression Testing
Ensures that new code changes do not affect the existing functionalities.

### d. Smoke Testing

### e. Sanity Testing
Verifies specific functionalities after changes.
### g. System Testing

### h. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
Validates the end-to-end business flow.

### a. Black Box Testing
Focuses on input and output without knowing the internal code.

### b. White Box Testing
Tests internal structures or workings of an application.

### c. Grey Box Testing
Combination of Black Box and White Box Testing.

## 6. Test Case & Test Scenario
**Test Case:** A set of actions executed to verify a particular feature or functionality.

**Test Scenario:** A high-level documentation of what to test.

**Example:**
- Test Scenario: Check login functionality
- Test Case: Enter valid username and password, click login, verify dashboard is displayed

## 7. Defect Life Cycle
The defect life cycle is the journey of a defect from its identification to its closure.

**Phases:** New, Assigned, Open, Fixed, Retest, Verified, Closed, Reopen

## 8. Test Plan
A test plan is a document detailing the objectives, resources, and processes for a specific test for a software or hardware product.

**Contents:** Scope, Approach, Resources, Schedule, Test Items, Features to be Tested, Deliverables
## 9. Test Report
A test report summarizes testing activities and results. It helps stakeholders understand the quality of the product.
## 10. Best Practices in Manual Testing
- Understand requirements thoroughly
- Log defects with detailed steps
- Communicate effectively with the team

## 11. Advantages and Disadvantages
**Advantages:**
- Easy to learn and implement

**Disadvantages:**
- Time-consuming
- Not suitable for large projects
- Prone to human error

## 12. Manual Testing vs Automation Testing
| Manual Testing | Automation Testing |
|---------------|--------------------|
| Performed by humans | Performed by tools/scripts |
| Time-consuming | Faster execution |
| Suitable for exploratory, ad-hoc, and usability testing | Suitable for regression, load, and performance testing |
