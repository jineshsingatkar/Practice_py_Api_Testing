## What is Programming?
Programming is the process of creating sets of instructions that tell a computer how to perform specific tasks. These instructions, known as code, are written in programming languages that computers understand and execute to carry out various operations, such as solving problems, analyzing data, or controlling devices.

## Popular Programming Languages
Some popular programming languages include:
- Python
- C
- C++
- Java
- Go
- C#

## What is Python?
Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability.

Just like we use human languages to communicate and express ourselves, Python is a language for computers to understand our instructions and perform tasks.

> **Note:** Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991.

According to Statista surveys, Python is the most popular programming language.

## Why Python?
- Python is one of the easiest programming languages to learn.
- It is known for its versatility and user-friendly syntax, making it a top choice among programmers.
- Python is open source (free) and has extensive libraries to make programming easy.
- It is widely used across different industries with excellent job opportunities.

## Python is Dynamically Typed (Example)
In Python, there is no need to declare a variable type; just assign a value:

```python
x = 8              # x is an integer
x = "Python by Rishabh Mishra"  # x is now a string
print(type(x))     # Output: <class 'str'>
```

You can check the type of `x` using the `type()` function.

### Example Programs

**Q1: Write a program to print “Hello World”**

```python
print("Hello World")
```

**Q2: Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10**

```python
for i in range(1, 11):
	print(i)
```

These examples show that Python is simple to write and read.

## Careers with Python
Python is not only one of the most popular programming languages in the world, but it also offers great career opportunities. The demand for Python developers is growing every year.
